## 🎯 Purpose
This project demonstrates how to use mathematical operations and the `Math` class in Java.  
It’s designed for beginners to understand how to perform calculations, take user input, and display results in the console.

---

## 💻 How It Works
1. The user enters the lengths of the two perpendicular sides (`a` and `b`) of a right triangle.  
2. The program calculates the hypotenuse (`h`) using the Pythagorean theorem:  
h = √(a² + b²)

3. The result (the hypotenuse) is displayed to the user.

## 🧠 Example Output
First Side :
3
Second Side :
4
HYPOTENUSE : 5.0
